# path-of-clarity-java

A Star Trek text adventure based on the Deep Space Nine episode "You Are Cordially Invited". This is my first complete game, built during my first collegiate programming course. Later remade in the Twine text game engine.

The Twine remake can be found [here](https://unitvector.itch.io/the-path-of-clarity).


#### Usage:

- In terminal, navigate to the 'clarity/' directory and enter 'java clarity' to run the game.

- Requires: JDK 10 or later
